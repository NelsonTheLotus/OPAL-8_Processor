# OPAL-8 Architecture

OPAL-8 is an 8bit processor architecture. This project also includes an assembler as well as schematics to build a computer with this processor.

## Description:
>**OPAL-8 is a fully custom 8 bit processor architecture.** 
Designed to run at 10MHz, it has 18 different instructions, a 16bit addressing bus for 
access of up to 65KB of memory and 8 different registers. Includes a VGA video card capable of 
displaying 15 different colors at 60Hz in a 150x200 resolution.

## Schematic
>Schematics are included in the circuit folder. The **Computer_Diagram.circ** file is a logic circuit,
 while the **TI74CDO01CMOS.circ** is designed with the texas instrument 74 series CMOS logic gates 
 in mind. 

## Assembler
>The assembler for this architecture is included in the Assembler folder,
 where more information is available.

## More Information
>Documentation for this architecture as well as the assembler is currently not publicly available.
